# ENG-TR-Dictionary
A dictionary made using Flask and a CSV file

It's a responsive site that I made using Flask and Bootstrap.
It has two pages one devoted to English-Turkish translations and other is devoted to Turkish-English translations.

The site's authorization password is "mentörşip". By using this password you can access the logs in /loglar/logs.txt.
If you do not sign in with this authorizated password, then you won't be able to see the logs.
